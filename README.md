## About This Repository
This repository showcases a machine learning project that predicts company bankruptcy using financial ratios. Implemented in Google Colab, it covers a full data science workflow including data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression & KNN), evaluation, and financial insight analysis.

# Key Highlights:
- Predicts bankruptcy based on liquidity, profitability, leverage, and efficiency ratios
- Compares Logistic Regression and KNN performance
- Identifies critical financial factors influencing bankruptcy
- Uses Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
